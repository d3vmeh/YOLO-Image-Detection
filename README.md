# YOLO-Image-Detection
This repository contains code for detecting objects in single images as well as video footage.

Darknet is used to draw bounding boxes around the objects and classify them. These boxes are then drawn on the original image with the labels included. For the video, each frame is analyzed and edited by Darknet before being pieced together to recreate the video with the annotated frames.
